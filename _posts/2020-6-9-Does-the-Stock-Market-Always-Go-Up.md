title: Does the Stock Market Always Go Up?
---

Let's take a look at $SPY, an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500.

For context, the stock market has miraculously almost rebounded from the point at which the free-fall due to COVID-19 fear started in February 20, 2020.

What if we bought a share in January 1, 2000?

The cost at open was $148.25 USD. At the time of writing, $SPY is at $320.79.

We more than doubled our cash, not bad! Well, not quite.

Due to inflation, we have to account for how much our $320.79 share of $SPY was worth in 2000 to determine the true return on our investment.

Our $320.79 was only worth $215.45 in 2000. To recalculate our return on investment, we do:

($215.45 - $148.25) / $148.25 = â€­0.453, or a 45.33% return. This is equivalent to investing $100 in 2000, and then getting back $145.33 in 2020. 

Let's put this into perspective: Over 20 years, that gives us a compound annual growth rate of 1.89% every year. Doesn't seem so great now, does it? That is not accounting for the stress of having to weather recessions, knowing that you can't sell the stock or else you may even come up negative after all those years of investing. 

Edit: A friend pointed out: what about dividend payments? This site makes it seem that dividends average out to about 2% annually. I don't feel like doing the math right now, but an overestimate is that $SPY returns 4% annually. Which is alright, I guess?

However, I concede that at least the market is trending upwards, just at a snails pace. I'm not sure buying a mutual fund from your happy-go-lucky stockbroker is worth it either, as most mutual funds underperform the S&P 500 (92% trail the index after 15 years! That's ridiculous, you wouldn't find Vegas odds that bad)

One more thing to note: Had you bought your stock in August 2000, you would have only seen red up until October 2007... which is the month where the Great Recession started... and you would not have broke even until March 2013! That means no nominal gains in 13 years of duly investing in index funds,  and in fact you even lost money due to inflation (It would have been worth $109.59, a loss of $38.66). 

Ultimately, it does seem that based on recent times, index fund investing is an okay way to keep your money over long periods of time (decades+). However, the returns are noticeably paltry, and a behavioral economist or a psychologist would have to weigh in on whether the stress caused by seeing your investment dip during recessions is worth the average 1.89% annual returns. There may even be an argument here that keeping that money in your bank account is better for your sanity. You get hurt by inflation, but maybe for the better.

Lesson? Go learn to make some money off of poker! I don't know. Perhaps learn to be in the top 8% of investors that beat the S&P 500 after 15 years of investing if you've got the guts. Learn how to make value for yourself, because a lot of nuance is lost and bad decision making is formed when people say "the stock market only goes up".
